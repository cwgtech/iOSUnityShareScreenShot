# iOSUnityShareScreenShot

This extends the base plugin with a ShareScreenShot method, allowing an iOS native UIActivityViewController to be displayed and interacted with in Unity.

This uses a callback reference to directly call a function in C# when the user finishes interacting with the UIActivityViewController.
